# clipboard-website
with Graham code long
this is a change made in Github online
heres is another change
Hi Graham.  Sunday 19:30.  Here is part 1 of 2 of my homework - the finalised Clipboard site for mobile.  I'll add the desktop part tmrw (Monday AM)
Some concerns/questions:
The icons for blacklists and snippets.  I thought the code you used was as below, but I can't make it work.  Margin auto seemed to do the trick tho
 /* background-position: center center; background-repeat: no-repeat; */

I used an img for the logo in the footer - so I could easily control the size and as I am not envisaging it being a background to anything.  Why is the logo in the header set as background?
I used grid for partner logos - I guess flex would have been better is its lonely 1 column.  Should the foot nav be in a flexbox?
The spacing doesn't look right in the footer and the fonts logo size on the footer doesn't look right - logo too small and fonts too big (but Figma says 30 sq for logo and 18 for the font). 

And the grey looks too dark but I did use the right #.  And I just don't know how to get rid of the left/right gutters.
Not sure how to control the gap between footer nav and social icons.  I thought it would be margin-bottom.
More to follow....
